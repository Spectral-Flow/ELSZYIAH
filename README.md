## Secrets & Deployment Notes

To enable hosted LLM inference or automatic Vercel deployments, set the following environment variables in your deployment environment or GitHub Actions secrets:

- `ELYSIA_USE_HOSTED=true` - Enable Hugging Face Inference adapter
- `ELYSIA_HF_API_KEY` - Your Hugging Face API key (store as a secret)
- `ELYSIA_HF_MODEL` - Optional: model id to use (default: `bigscience/bloom-560m`)

Vercel automatic deploys from GitHub require a `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret in the repository settings. To add it:

1. Create a personal token at https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret
3. Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` with the token value

The GitHub Actions workflow will attempt a Vercel deploy on pushes to `main` if `VERCEL_TOKEN` is present.
