```powershell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Spectral-Flow/ELSZYIAH.git
cd ELSZYIAH

# Install Python dependencies (lite version)
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# Or: source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements-lite.txt

# Run with mock AI (default)
python -m uvicorn elysia_lite:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run with BLOOM LLM (smallest model)
$env:ELYSIA_USE_BLOOM="true"
python -m uvicorn elysia_lite:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Mobile/Termux (Android)

```bash
# Install Termux packages
pkg update && pkg install python git

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Spectral-Flow/ELSZYIAH.git
cd ELSZYIAH/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-lite.txt

# Run server (mock or BLOOM)
python -m uvicorn elysia_lite:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. Vercel Cloud Deployment

- Edit `vercel.json` to use `backend/elysia_lite.py`.
- Push to GitHub, then run:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

- Set environment variable `ELYSIA_USE_BLOOM=true` for LLM mode (default is mock).

### 4. API Endpoints

- `POST /api/elysia/request` — Concierge chat
- `GET /api/elysia/amenities` — Amenity info
- `GET /api/elysia/community` — Community info
- `GET /health` — Health check

---

## Secrets & Deployment Notes

To enable hosted LLM inference or automatic Vercel deployments, set the following environment variables in your deployment environment or GitHub Actions secrets:

- `ELYSIA_USE_HOSTED=true` - Enable Hugging Face Inference adapter
- `ELYSIA_HF_API_KEY` - Your Hugging Face API key (store as a secret)
- `ELYSIA_HF_MODEL` - Optional: model id to use (default: `bigscience/bloom-560m`)

Vercel automatic deploys from GitHub require a `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret in the repository settings. To add it:

1. Create a personal token at https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret
3. Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` with the token value

The GitHub Actions workflow will attempt a Vercel deploy on pushes to `main` if `VERCEL_TOKEN` is present.
